```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

smaller <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(carat <= 2.5)
```

We have data about `r nrow(diamonds)` diamonds. Only 
`r nrow(diamonds) - nrow(smaller)` are larger than
2.5 carats. The distribution of the remainder is shown
below:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
smaller %>% 
  ggplot(aes(carat)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.01)
```
The count of diamonds have a sharp uptick at just about every half carat interval. However, there seems to be a sharp drop-off just before every half interval. This would indicate that diamond tend to exist at a, somewhat, set number of carats without too much variation inbetween.
